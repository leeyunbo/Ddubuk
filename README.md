Location based Sns using AR 
------------------------------------
there are two functions 
(1) AR Message 
(2) AR Navigation 

These functions are implemented using latitude and longitude.

representative algorithm is the haversine algorithm.

The haversine formula determines the great-circle distance between two points on a sphere given their longitudes and latitudes.
